## Overview

These are forms for ITDRC use in the [Pat Winlink Client](https://getpat.io/). The HTML forms are maintained by me, Rob Levesque (KB1LHQ), for use by ITDRC members

Much of the backing code for the form was originally a Winlink form that Pat had compatibility for. Some compatibility may remain but there is no promise. I have no way of testing if that is true.


## Installation
Find the Standard_Forms directory (for me that is `~/.local/share/pat/Standard_Forms/`) and place the ITDRC folder located in this repository to it. It should show up as a folder in Pat. If the forms are updated, it may need to be put back in place. When/if Pat starts to include a custom or personal forms directory I will attempt to update these directions.

You may need to restart Pat or refresh the page or all of the above in order for this to show up.


## Quick guide to use
In order to use this after installation you would compose a message. In the message composition form there is a button near the bottom that is labeled 'Template'. Click it and a list of templates should appear. 'ITDRC' should appear as a folder of sorts and any of the forms created should appear below that. Click the form, and fill it out.


## Thanks to

Thanks to Todd Clausen for the original form that this attempts to fill out for. Also thanks to the original designers of the base Winlink form that this built from as well as Winlink themselves and the developers of the Pat client.
