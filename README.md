## Overview

These are forms for ITDRC use in the [Pat Winlink Client](https://getpat.io/). The HTML forms are maintained by me, Rob Levesque (KB1LHQ), for use by ITDRC members

Much of the backing code for the form was originally a Winlink form that Pat had compatibility for. Some compatibility may remain but there is no promise. I have no way of testing if that is true.


## Installation
Find the Standard_Forms directory (for me that is `~/.local/share/pat/Standard_Forms/`) and place the ITDRC folder located in this repository to it. It should show up as a folder in Pat. If the forms are updated, it may need to be put back in place. When/if Pat starts to include a custom or personal forms directory I will attempt to update these directions.


## Thanks to

Thanks to Todd Clausen for the original form that this attempts to fill out for. Also thanks to the original designers of the base Winlink form that this built from as well as Winlink themselves and the developers of the Pat client.
